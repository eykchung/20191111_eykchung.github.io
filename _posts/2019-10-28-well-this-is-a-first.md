  Here be the first post on this site regaling a tale of the journey of getting
  this site up and running.  Should be interesting as to how the design is going
  to turn out.  This post might be later deleted.

As for the first changes made, it's the author selection in the admin pages to being my own name.  Had a couple mishaps with the original admin file, so hopefully he doesn't pay any mind to that..  Aspirational stuff to want to include for this portfolio is a collection of other blog posts following the development of this site.  Other aspirational stuff will include: a project from my final project for my UX project regarding a possible empathy learning/training app for Ux designers, a couple redesigns for a chair, the redesign of a pizza ordering interface  ...  more will be added later
